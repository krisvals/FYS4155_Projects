    "regression problems by developing our own feed-forward neural network\n",
    "(FFNN) code. We can reuse the regression algorithms studied in project\n",

    "a. A simple one-dimensional function or the Franke function or the terrain data from project 1, or data sets your propose. It could be a simpler function than the Franke function. We recommend testing a simpler function (see below). But if you wish to try more complex function, feel free to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification. Here you will also need to develop a Logistic regression code that you will use to compare with the Neural Network code. The data set we propose are the so-called [Wisconsin Breat Cancer Data](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) data set of images representing various features of tumors. These are discussed intensively in the lecture notes, see for example the slides from [week 41](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/week41/html/week41.html).
